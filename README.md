# Frenetic

Frenetic was an HTML5 client for connecting to Skotos games, designed for accessibility post extension deprecation. Based on Javascript and WebSockets.

It is no longer in use or supported, and is archived here only for archival and historical purposes.

The final client used today is [Orchil](https://github.com/ChatTheatre/orchil) used with [Websock to TCP Tunnel](https://github.com/ChatTheatre/websocket-to-tcp-tunnel).
